# TextGame

Basic text-based game written in Python. I wrote this in an attempt to get a grasp of objects in Python, while practicing other elements of Python.

## The Game
The game, in its current state, allows the player to choose between two classes, Wizard and Barbarian. Each class deals a different amount of damage and has a different damage modifier.

To run the game, make sure you have Python installed. Run the game.py file.
